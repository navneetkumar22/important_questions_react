# React - Important Questions

### 1. What is React?

**Answer:** React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.

### 2. What are the advantages of using React?

**Answer:** 
- **Reusable Components:** Write once, use anywhere.
- **Virtual DOM:** Efficiently updates and renders components.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Makes it easier to debug.
- **JSX:** Simplifies the process of writing components.
- **Strong Community Support:** Plenty of resources and libraries available.

### 3. What are the limitations of React?

**Answer:**
- **High Pace of Development:** Constant updates can be overwhelming.
- **Learning Curve:** JSX and the component-based approach can be challenging for newcomers.
- **Poor Documentation:** Often outpaced by updates.
- **SEO Challenges:** Although improved, single-page applications can still face SEO issues.

### 4. What is JSX?

**Answer:** JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows developers to write HTML structures in the same file as JavaScript code, making the code easier to understand and debug.

**Example:**
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### 5. What are the ways to create a new React app?

**Answer:**
- **Create React App (CRA):** A command-line tool to quickly set up a new React project.
- **Next.js:** For server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Manual Setup:** Configuring Webpack and Babel for more control.

### 6. What is NPM?

**Answer:** NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript, enabling developers to install, share, and manage dependencies for their projects.

### 7. What is the difference between npm and yarn? Which one to use and why?

**Answer:**
- **npm:** Default package manager for Node.js.
- **Yarn:** Developed by Facebook, offers faster performance, and better caching and offline capabilities.
- **Which to use:** Depends on the project requirements and team preference. Yarn is often chosen for its speed and reliability.

### 8. What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` file?

**Answer:**
- **package.json:** Lists the project's dependencies and scripts.
- **package-lock.json:** Records the exact version of each installed package, ensuring consistent installs across environments.

### 9. What is a component in React?

**Answer:** A component is an independent, reusable piece of UI in a React application. It can be a class or a function.

**Example:**
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### 10. What is props in React?

**Answer:** Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component, allowing data to flow between components.

**Example:**
```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
<Greeting name="Alice" />
```

### 11. What is state in React?

**Answer:** State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component. State is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function). When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

**Example:**
```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.state.count}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### 12. What is the difference between props and state?

**Answer:**
- **Props:** Read-only, passed from parent to child components, used to pass data and event handlers.
- **State:** Managed within the component, can change over time, used for dynamic data that affects rendering.

### 13. What is the difference between functional and class components?

**Answer:**
- **Functional Components:** Stateless, simpler, use hooks for state and lifecycle methods.
- **Class Components:** Stateful, more complex, use `this.state` and lifecycle methods.

**Example of Functional Component:**
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

**Example of Class Component:**
```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### 14. What is Virtual DOM in React?

**Answer:** The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. React updates the Virtual DOM first and then reconciles it with the real DOM, resulting in efficient updates.

### 15. What is props drilling?

**Answer:** Props drilling refers to the process of passing data from one component through several intermediate components to a deeply nested component. This can make the code harder to maintain.

### 16. What are React Hooks?

**Answer:** Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They allow you to use state, lifecycle methods, and other features without writing a class.

### 17. Explain the important hooks in React.

**Answer:**
- **useState:** Manages state in functional components.
- **useEffect:** Manages side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.
- **useContext:** Accesses context values without using a Consumer component.
- **useReducer:** Manages state using reducers, an alternative to useState for complex state logic.

### 18. Explain the working of the useEffect hook.

**Answer:** `useEffect` performs side effects in functional components. It runs after the first render and after every update. You can control when it runs by providing a dependency array.

**Example:**
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
```

### 19. What is a custom hook?

**Answer:** A custom hook is a function that allows you to reuse stateful logic between components. Custom hooks use standard React hooks internally.

**Example:**
```jsx
function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  return { count, increment };
}
```

### 20. What is strict mode in React?

**Answer:** StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.

**Example:**
```jsx
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>
```

### 21. What is a bundler and its need in React?

**Answer:** A bundler is a tool that compiles JavaScript modules into a single file (or a few files) that the browser can load efficiently. It’s essential in React to manage dependencies, optimize performance, and ensure all required assets are included in the final build.

### 22. What are the techniques used to optimize the React app performance?

**Answer:**
- **Code Splitting:** Dynamically import parts of the application.
- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Lazy Loading:** Load components only when needed using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
- **PureComponent:** Use `React.PureComponent` or `React.memo` to reduce re-rendering.
- **Virtualize Long Lists:** Use libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.

### 23. What are the different phases of the component lifecycle?

**Answer:**
- **Mounting:** Constructor, `static getDerivedStateFromProps`, `render`, `componentDidMount`.
- **Updating:** `static getDerivedStateFromProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `render`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate`.
- **Unmounting:** `componentWillUnmount`.

### 24. What is a controlled and uncontrolled component in React?

**Answer:**
- **Controlled Component:** The form data is handled by the React component using state.
- **Uncontrolled Component:** The form data is handled by the DOM itself, using refs to access form values.

**Example of Controlled Component:**
```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

**Example of Uncontrolled Component:**
```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}
```

### 25. What is the need for a key prop while rendering list objects?

**Answer:** The key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be unique and help in efficiently updating the UI by minimizing re-renders.

### 26. What are higher-order components (HOC)?

**Answer:** HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behaviors. They are used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and manipulation of props.

**Example:**
```jsx
function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
  return function(props) {
    console.log('Props:', props);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}
```

### 27. What is React Router DOM?

**Answer:** React Router DOM is a library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different views or pages in a single-page application without reloading the page.

### 28. What is the difference between using the “a tag” and “Link tag” from React Router DOM?

**Answer:** 
- **`a` tag:** Causes a full page reload, which defeats the purpose of a single-page application.
- **`Link` tag:** Allows for client-side navigation without a page reload, preserving the state and improving performance.

### 29. How to create dynamic routes?

**Answer:**
Dynamic routes can be created using the `Route` component with a path that includes a parameter.

**Example:**
```jsx
<Route path="/user/:id" component={UserDetail} />
```

In `UserDetail` component, you can access the `id` parameter using `useParams` hook.

**Example:**
```jsx
function UserDetail() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return <div>User ID: {id}</div>;
}
```

### 30. Explain conditional rendering in React.

**Answer:** Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like `if`, `&&`, `||`, and ternary operators to conditionally render components.

**Example using Ternary Operator:**
```jsx
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign up.</h1>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Example using `&&`:**
```jsx
function Warning({ showWarning }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {showWarning && <p>This is a warning!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 31. What is the reconciliation algorithm in React?

**Answer:** The reconciliation algorithm in React is a process that compares the current Virtual DOM with the previous one to determine the minimum number of changes required to update the UI. This process efficiently updates the real DOM by only making necessary changes.

### 32. What is Redux Toolkit?

**Answer:** Redux Toolkit is an official, opinionated, and efficient toolset for Redux development. It simplifies the process of writing Redux logic, providing tools like `configureStore`, `createSlice`, and `createAsyncThunk` to streamline setup and reduce boilerplate code.

### 33. What is the difference between the Context Hook and Redux Toolkit? Why should we prefer Redux Toolkit over the Context Hook?

**Answer:**
- **Context Hook (`useContext`):** Suitable for small-scale state management, allows passing data through the component tree without prop drilling.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Suitable for larger applications, provides a robust state management solution with advanced features like middleware, asynchronous actions, and dev tools integration.
- **Preference for Redux Toolkit:** For larger, more complex applications, Redux Toolkit offers better structure, scalability, and debugging tools compared to the Context API.

### 34. What is the importance of React DevTools?

**Answer:** React DevTools is a browser extension that allows developers to inspect and debug React component hierarchies in the browser. It helps in analyzing component structures, checking props and state, and optimizing performance.

### 35. What is the importance of Redux DevTools?

**Answer:** Redux DevTools is a tool for debugging Redux applications. It allows developers to inspect every action and state change, providing time travel debugging, action replay, and state import/export capabilities.

### 36. What is SPA?

**Answer:** SPA (Single-Page Application) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user interacts with the app. This provides a smoother, faster user experience without full page reloads.

### 37. What is Webpack and Babel?

**Answer:**
- **Webpack:** A module bundler that packages JavaScript modules into a single bundle or multiple chunks for deployment.
- **Babel:** A JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backward-compatible versions for older browsers.

### 38. What is a CDN and how to use CDN for React?

**Answer:** A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers distributed globally to deliver content more efficiently. You can use a CDN for React by linking React and ReactDOM libraries via CDN URLs in your HTML file, reducing the load on your server.

**Example:**
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/17.0.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/17.0.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
```

### 39. What is the difference between `useState` and `useReducer` hook?

**Answer:**
- **`useState`:** Simpler state management for individual state variables.
- **`useReducer`:** More powerful state management for complex state logic, similar to Redux reducers, managing state with a reducer function and actions.

### 40. What is Axios?

**Answer:** Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It simplifies making HTTP requests, handling responses, and performing operations like intercepting requests, transforming data, and handling errors.

### 41. What is action, store, and reducer in Redux?

**Answer:**
- **Action:** An object describing a change, with a `type` and optional payload.
- **Store:** The central repository for application state, created with `createStore`.
- **Reducer:** A pure function that takes the current state and an action, returning the new state.

### 42. How to make an API call while using Redux Toolkit?

**Answer:**
Using `createAsyncThunk` to handle async logic:
```javascript
import { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import axios from 'axios';

export const fetchData = createAsyncThunk('data/fetch', async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('/api/data');
  return response.data;
});

const dataSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'data',
  initialState: { data: [], status: 'idle', error: null },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchData.pending, (state) => {
        state.status = 'loading';
      })
      .addCase(fetchData.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'succeeded';
        state.data = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchData.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'failed';
        state.error = action.error.message;
      });
  },
});
```

### 43. What is Jest and React Testing Library?

**Answer:**
- **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, commonly used for testing React applications.
- **React Testing Library:** A library for testing React components by focusing on user interactions and the DOM output, ensuring more reliable and maintainable tests.

### 44. What is lazy loading?

**Answer:** Lazy loading is a technique where components or resources are loaded only when needed, improving initial load times and performance. In React, `React.lazy` and `Suspense` are used for lazy loading components.

**Example:**
```jsx
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

### 45. What are the different features provided by a bundler?

**Answer:**
- **Code Splitting:** Breaking code into smaller chunks for on-demand loading.
- **Tree Shaking:** Removing unused code.
- **Asset Management:** Handling CSS, images, and other assets.
- **Module Resolution:** Resolving dependencies and modules.
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Updating modules without a full reload.
- **Minification and Optimization:** Reducing file sizes and improving performance.
